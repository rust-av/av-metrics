## Video Metrics implemented

 - [X] PSNR
 - [X] APSNR
 - [X] PSNR HVS
 - [X] SSIM
 - [X] MSSSIM
 - [X] CIEDE2000

## Installation

### As a library

Add the following to your Cargo.toml
```toml
av-metrics = "0.7"
```

Then check out [the API docs](https://docs.rs/av-metrics/).

### As a binary

#### Windows

Download the latest binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/rust-av/av-metrics/releases) tab.

#### OS X and Linux

Pre-built binaries are coming soon. In the meantime, have the latest stable Rust
installed and run the following:

```
cargo install av-metrics-tool
```

#### Usage

From any terminal, run the executable with your two video files as arguments:

```
âžœ av-metrics-tool lossless.y4m lossy.y4m
```

You should receive output for all supported metrics:

```
PSNR - Y: 32.5281  U: 36.4083  V: 39.8238  Avg: 33.6861
APSNR - Y: 32.5450  U: 36.4087  V: 39.8244  Avg: 33.6995
PSNR HVS - Y: 34.3225  U: 37.7400  V: 40.5569  Avg: 31.8674
SSIM - Y: 13.2572  U: 10.8624  V: 12.8369  Avg: 12.6899
MSSSIM - Y: 18.8343  U: 16.6943  V: 18.7662  Avg: 18.3859
CIEDE2000 - 36.2820
```

By default, the tool can only decode y4m files. Both files must match in resolution, bit depth, and color sampling.

Alternate input formats can be supported by enabling FFMpeg support.
Due to limitations, this currently has to be enabled at compile time.

In the crate, this can be enabled with the feature "ffmpeg-decode".
In the binary, this can be enabled with the feature "ffmpeg".
